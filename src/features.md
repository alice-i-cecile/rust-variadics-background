# Feature Prioritization

Based on the [use cases](use-cases/use-cases.md) examined, how can we split out and prioritize the features of variadics?

This is a measure of *importance*, and should be weighed against difficulty (and path-dependent effects) when deciding how to proceed in practice.

## Essential

The *bare* minimum feature set for someone to truthfully say "Rust has variadics now!".

## Important

Features that will actively frustrate users of variadics if they're missing.

## Useful

Features that everyone can agree would be nice to have, but that users can live without for now.

## Controversial

Features that could be cool, but may cause massive headaches or encourage questionable patterns.
