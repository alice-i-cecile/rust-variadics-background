# Implementation proposals

There are *many* proposals, which may be more or less related, about how we could implement variadics in Rust.

Proposals:

- **must** be able to meet all of the **essential** [features](../features.md)
- **should** be able to meet all of the **important** features
- it **would be nice** if they were able to meet all of the nice-to-have features

Like always, proposals should be:

- clear
- minimally invasive
- reversible
- extensible
