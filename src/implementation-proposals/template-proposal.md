## Features provided

Variadic tuples:

- [ ] Heterogenous variadic tuples
- [ ] Tuple item trait bounds
- [ ] Tuple value iteration
- [ ] Tuple trait
- [ ] Tuple type manipulation
- [ ] Homogenous variadic tuples
- [ ] Variadic tuple destructuring
  
Variadic functions:

- [ ] Homogenous variadic functions
- [ ] Heterogenous variadic functions
- [ ] Argument packing and unpacking
- [ ] Homogenous variadic arguments implement `IntoIterator`

## Detailed explanation

Explain the design in sufficient detail that:

- Its interaction with other features is clear.
- It is reasonably clear how the feature would be implemented.
- Corner cases are dissected by example.

## Strengths

What unique benefits does this approach have?

## Drawbacks

Why should we not do this?

## Rationale

### Why didn't you do this obvious thing?

Because it actually wouldn't work.

### Why did you do X?

For subtle reasons, this enables us to...

## Prior art

Discuss prior art, both the good and the bad, in relation to this proposal.
