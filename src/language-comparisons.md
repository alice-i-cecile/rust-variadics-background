# Variadics in other languages

Variadics are a (relatively) popular programming language feature, and learning from the things that other languages did right (or wrong) is essential to success.

If you're familiar with a language that implemented variadics in any form, please contribute!
The more esoteric its implementation and the more cursed its usage the better.

Variadics in other languages are tracked in [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QAuaStrO73uPiyNc8bbCgXDmxue7afz2pped9W0Ucus/edit#gid=0).
Please use comments to discuss implementation details, limitations or notes for each language / feature combination.
