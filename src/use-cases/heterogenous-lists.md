# Use case: Heterogenous lists

In one sentence, what do users want to do?

```rust
let example = demonstrates_functionality();

assert!(example.is_concise());
```

## Features needed

### Variadic functions

- [ ] E: Homogenous variadic functions

### Variadic tuples

- [ ] E: Tuple trait
- [ ] E: Tuple item trait bounds
- [ ] E: Tuple value iteration
- [ ] I: Explicit variadic tuples

- [ ] U: Tuple manipulation

### Variadic generics

- [ ] E: Unbounded variadic generics
- [ ] E: Variadic generic trait bounds
- [ ] E: Variadic generic type iteration
