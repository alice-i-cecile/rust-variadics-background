# Variadics in other languages

Variadics are a (relatively) popular programming language feature, and learning from the things that other languages did right (or wrong) is essential to success.

If you're familiar with a language that implemented variadics in any form, please [contribute](https://github.com/alice-i-cecile/rust-variadics-background)!
The more esoteric its implementation and the more cursed its usage the better.
